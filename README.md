Evaluate overfitting of decision trees in scikit-learn using the max_depth parameter

To evaluate overfitting of decision trees in scikit-learn using the max_depth parameter, you can follow these steps to build different models and generate a plot comparing the accuracy on training and test data. 

## Step-by-Step

1.  Loading the Data: Load the dataset and inspect the first few rows to understand its structure and data types.
2.  Inspecting the Data: Display the first few rows and data types to understand the structure and identify categorical columns.
3.  One-Hot Encoding: Perform one-hot encoding for the smoker and outcome columns.
4.  Identifying Target Column: Determine the correct target column (outcome_Alive or outcome_Dead).
5.  Defining Features and Target: Include the age column along with the encoded smoker column as features, and set the target variable.
6.  Splitting Data: Split the data into training and test sets.
7.  Training Models: Train decision tree models with different max_depth values and track the accuracy on training and test sets.
8.  Plotting Results: Plot the accuracies to visualize overfitting and underfitting.

## Result

Based on the provided plot showing the accuracy of the decision tree model on the training and test sets for varying max_depth, we can draw the following conclusions:

## Initial Underfitting:

At low depths (1-2), both training and test accuracies are relatively low, indicating underfitting. The model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
Optimal Depth:

The training accuracy stabilizes around a max depth of 5, and the test accuracy remains consistently high around this depth. This suggests that the model captures the data patterns well without overfitting.
The test accuracy peaks slightly around depths 3-4, indicating that the model performs well on unseen data at these depths.
Overfitting Not Evident:

Interestingly, the training accuracy does not increase significantly with deeper trees, and the test accuracy remains stable. Typically, overfitting would be indicated by a high training accuracy and a drop in test accuracy at higher depths. However, in this case, the accuracies are stable, suggesting that the deeper trees are not capturing noise excessively.

## Key Learnings:

Model Complexity: The decision tree reaches an optimal complexity around a max depth of 5, where it balances bias and variance effectively.

**Model Stability:** The stability of the test accuracy across varying depths indicates a robust model that generalizes well to unseen data.
Cross-Validation:

Further validation using cross-validation techniques could help confirm these findings and ensure that the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the data.
Implications for Decision Tree Building:
Pruning:

To avoid potential overfitting, especially in larger datasets, it might be beneficial to implement pruning techniques that stop the tree from growing beyond a certain depth.
Regularization:

Consider using regularization parameters like min_samples_split or min_samples_leaf to control the growth of the tree further and maintain its generalization capabilities.
Validation:

Regularly validate the model using cross-validation to ensure that the selected depth generalizes well across different data splits.
Recommendations:
Select Optimal Depth:

Based on the plot, a max depth of around 5 seems optimal for this dataset. This depth balances training and test accuracies effectively without overfitting.
Monitor Performance:

Keep track of model performance over time and re-evaluate if new data is introduced or if the data distribution changes.
Experiment with Hyperparameters:

Experiment with other hyperparameters and techniques to enhance model performance, such as using ensemble methods like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting that can improve robustness and accuracy.
By following these recommendations, you can develop a more reliable and effective decision tree model for your dataset, ensuring good performance and generalization to unseen data.
